To generate code run the following command:
    build.py

Or you may specify project type manually:
    build.py -t <project_type>
    Example: build.py -t "Visual Studio 11"

You may list project types by command:
    build.py -l

Code will be placed to _build/<project_type> directory.
Executables and dynamic libraries will be built to _build/<project_type>/bin directory
Static libraries will be built to _build/<project_type>/lib directory
